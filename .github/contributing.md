Welcome to the BEE2.4 Default Pack issue tracker! If you found a bug in BEE2.4 or want to suggest a new feature, you've come to the right place. That being said, however, don't just go open your issue immediately. To keep the issue tracker organized, we have some guidelines you should follow when opening issues.

### Post on the correct repository.
There are two BEEmod repositories. This one, BEE2-items, should be used for issues related to items, styles, and other content contained in packages. [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/issues) is for issues related to the application itself. If you accidentally open an issue on the wrong repository, we can transfer it over. However, it's better to open it on the correct repository to begin with.

### Check for an existing issue.
We don't need multiple issues open about the same bug or feature. Before posting anything, please make sure the issue is not on the [Known Issues](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/Known-Issues) wiki page; even if it isn't, perform a search to make sure it hasn't already been reported. Duplicate issues are unnecessary and will immediately be closed, no matter how severe an issue it may be. Do not intentionally open a duplicate issue to remind us about a bug/feature. Comments exist for a reason.

### Provide as much information as possible.
When reporting a bug, first make sure you're on the latest version of the mod, as the issue may have already been fixed. If the bug still exists, tell us what style you're using, and provide a screenshot or video of it. If you're getting a compile error, open the developer console and copy and paste the error (the red text) into the issue. If you have experience with Hammer, you can be even more helpful by trying to debug the issue yourself. If someone provides a solution to the issue or asks for more detail, please respond.

This applies to feature requests as well; describe in detail what the feature is, how it should function, what properties an item should have, etc. The more information you provide, the faster we'll be able to fix/implement the issue. We will close issues if we are unable to fix them because we don't have enough information.

### Don't open an issue to ask a question.
The issue tracker is not the place to ask questions. This creates unnecessary issues which are only open for a brief period of time before being closed once the question is answered. If you have a question, first read the [FAQ](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/FAQ); if you can't find it there you can ask your question on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EvC8Fku).

### Don't combine issues.
While it might seem efficient to put all of your bugs/suggestions in one post, this has several drawbacks. Each item can't be individually labelled, or closed once it is fixed/implemented. If you have multiple unrelated bug reports or feature requests, please create separate issues instead of combining them. The issues can then be automatically closed when an update that fixes them is released. There are a few exceptions to this rule - for example, if you're reporting multiple bugs with one specific item, it's usually okay, though separate issues are probably still preferred.

### New suggestions
BEEmod cannot modify the game code, and is not a Hammer replacement. Keep these points in mind when suggesting a new feature:

- Things should already be present in Portal 1/2 or a existing mod/map: This keeps content to things which actually fit in the game, and are possible in the engine.
- No beta content: Most of these resources aren't publicly available, and it's a very unfinished and incoherent mess of parts.
- No, we won't develop your custom style for you. Styles require a lot of work and maintenance.
- Focus on puzzle potential: In general, items should be focused on providing new opportunities for puzzles, not solely for decoration purposes.
- Versatility is key: For the most part, good new items maximise their flexibility in different situations, especially in improving the puzzle experience. We're not adding some item that only works for your specific map.

### Other requirements
A User must be at least 13 years of age as per the [GitHub account requirement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#b-account-terms).

Remember to respect, be kind and polite towards contributors and other users. Being rude or using excessive swearing/offensive/pejorative language will make it less likely that you get help, might get your issue locked, and in more extreme cases, your account banned. Contributors are here to help however and whenever they can. Demanding solutions or tagging them will not get the job done any quicker, and will only cause inconveniences.

**Repeatedly failing to follow these guidelines may result in your account being banned from the BEE2.4 GitHub repositories.** Ban evasion is not acceptable, and will get your multiple accounts reported and most likely removed.

You should also read the [FAQ](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/FAQ), to answer some questions you might have about the mod.
