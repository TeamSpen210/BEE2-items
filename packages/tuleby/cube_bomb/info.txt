		"" "ON/OFF Portal Gun concept - Cube BOMB"
		"" ""
		"" "* A variant on the Reflection Cube, which is only usable for a short time period."
		"" "* The Bomb Cube is armed after the player places it down somewhere. After a configurable time, it explodes."
		"" "* The time is configurable by changing the cube type and is displayed above the cube in the editor."
		"" "* Ingame, the remaining time is shown by a dial around the back of the cube."
		"" "* Fizzling the cube will harmlessly destroy it."
		"" "* The explosion is able to kill the player, ignite turrets, knock away other cubes and break breakable glass."
		"" "* To place a dropper version, place the item underneath a regular cube dropper, or use the [timer to link them](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/Default-PeTI-Items#cubes)."
